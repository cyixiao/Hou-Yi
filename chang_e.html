        <p>
          After Hou Yi shot down the suns to save the world, he was deeply
          revered by the people. His wife, Chang'e, was known for her beauty and
          kindness, often aiding their impoverished neighbors. One day, Hou Yi
          received an elixir of immortality, but not wishing to live forever
          alone, he entrusted it to Chang'e for safekeeping.
        </p>
        <p>
          Peng Meng, a deceitful disciple of Hou Yi, learned of the elixir and
          threatened Chang'e to hand it over when Hou Yi was away. Knowing the
          disaster that would ensue if Peng Meng got the elixir, Chang'e
          swallowed it herself, and her body, light as a feather, floated
          towards the moon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hou Yi, upon his return, could only glimpse Chang'e's silhouette in
          the moonlight. Stricken with sorrow and unable to join her, he honored
          her memory by setting out food annually on the 15th day of the eighth
          lunar month. This act of remembrance for Chang'e's kindness and the
          hope for reunion gave birth to the Mid-Autumn Festival.
