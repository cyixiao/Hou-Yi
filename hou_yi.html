        <p>
          In Chinese mythology, there were originally 10 suns, in some forms of
          this myth they are the sons or grandsons of the Jade Emperor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially, the 10 suns would cross the sky one by one, but one day the
          10 suns decided to come out all at once so that they could play with
          each other, and scorching the earth. Hou Yi was tasked by the mythical
          King Yao to rein in the suns. Hou Yi first tried to reason with the
          suns. When that didn't work, he then pretended to shoot at them with
          his bow to intimidate them.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the suns again refused to heed Hou Yi's warnings, he began to
          shoot at them one by one. As each one fell, they turned into
          three-legged ravens. Finally, only one sun was left. King Yao and the
          sun's mother Xihe asked for him to be spared for the prosperity of
          man.
